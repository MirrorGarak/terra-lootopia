# Space Dollar - The Society

> Space Dollar is a CW20 token created by Midas, and airdropped to holders of SpaceLoot using a cubic root formula. The total supply of 15,240,278.55 (note, the two decimals) has been allocated to owners, no team allocation, no presales.

SDOLLAR is the "official" currency of The Society, for example, the Lootopian fellows were minted for 1000 SDOLLARs a piece!
Holding SDOLLAR, or providing liquidity will also get you entrance to channels on our Discord, that are for Society's eyes only.

There are to ways to become members:

 - hold 10k (or more) SDOLLARs **in your wallet**
 - hold 5.5 LPs from providing SDOLLAR-UST liquidity on the TerraFloki DEX

## How to Join The Society

> Make sure you double check the links found on this page with the ones on Discord! Remember, all kinds of shady people want to scam you out of your money.. Look our for the **#faq** and **#important-links channel**.

You never provided liquidity or did any yield farming yet? No worries, here is the deal.

Once you get this down, you will start earning yield, a portion of the trading fees paid by whoever buys or sells SDOLLAR. Simply by providing assets that you were (we are assuming) hodling on to anyway :)

## Get Some UST

> First, you have to get some UST. If you already have some UST in your terra wallet, go ahead to the next section.

The general steps are as follows:

1. Move USD or your preferred currency to a centralized exchange like Coinbase, Binance, depending on your location, preference, etc.
2. Purchase native Luna or UST on these exchanges.
3. Withdraw the Luna or UST to your Terra wallet address to have custody over your funds.

For the first two points please **refer to respectable online guides**. Research the topic before you jump in, such as what are the financial/tax legalities depending on your country. [TerraBites Podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCpsyNtR05I) is a good place to start, but **do your own research**. [CoinBureau](https://www.youtube.com/c/CoinBureau) on Youtube is a respectable channel to start learning about crypto in general, Godspeed!

For creating the wallet, you can follow the official documentation of Terra: [Terra Docs](https://docs.terra.money/index.html).

## Purchase SDOLLAR

> Liquidity is provided on the TerraFloki DEX, therefore you can buy SDOLLAR there. Remember to double check links from our Discord!
>
>> Note: If you want to provide 5.5 LP worth of liquidity rather for membership, than 5k SDOLLAR is enough, since you have to pair that with an equal worth of UST.

1. Navigate to the [TerraFloki DEX](https://terrafloki.io/app/trade) and connect your wallet.
2. By default the TFLOKI token is selected, so choose SDOLLAR from the dropdown list.
3. Specify the amount you want to trade. You need 10k SDOLLARs to be a member of the Society.
4. Click Swap and sign the transaction in the popup.

## And/Or Provide Liquidity

Providing liquidity is incentivized by The Society, the bigger to pool, the smaller the individual trades affect the price!

By staking your LLP token, you can farm tickets to purchase NFTs with. Please refer to our discord the [TerraFloki](https://terrafloki.io/launchpad/tickets/stakelp) launchpad for current farming events.

Be aware of the risks though, such as impermanent loss, you can learn about it from the awesome video below:

[![Finematics_impermanent_loss](https://img.youtube.com/vi/8XJ1MSTEuU0/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XJ1MSTEuU0)

1. Navigate to the [TerraFloki Pool](https://terrafloki.io/app/pool/provide).
2. From the scroll-down menu select SDOLLAR.
3. Set the amount to 5000 or a bit more and the UST will be matching your selection.
4. Click **Add Liquidity** and sign the transaction.
