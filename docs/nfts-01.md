## SpaceLoot Staking

You can stake one to four of your SpaceLoots to receive either **Scraps** or the more rare **Terranite** ore daily! Although exact utility is not yet defined, rest assured it will be used for crafting, upgrades, repairs, and so on :) You have 10% chance of hitting Terranite and 90% for Scraps for each of your staked ship.

![sl_staking_rewards](/images/scrap_terranite.jpg)

Use the v2 staking site on [Knowhere.art](https://v2.knowhere.art/metaverse/terra13qrc9j00lk3x0rvpptzdmwtckfj64d5g6xnrv9/staking) to stake your ships. 

> Unfortunately the fee for claiming the rewards is quite hefty if you do it on KA! However there is a workaround.. Follow our [guide](linktoguide) to shrink that fee to 1/10th of the original cost, to around 0.07 UST per transaction!

> Staking was meant to be for a limited time only, once you will be able to send ships on missions, the current form of staking will end.
