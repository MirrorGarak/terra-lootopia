# Our History

> Our history indirectly started with [SpaceLoot NFT](https://knowhere.art/collections/terra13qrc9j00lk3x0rvpptzdmwtckfj64d5g6xnrv9), the first NFT minted on the Terra network in early September. This collection of 8001 text representation of spaceships was released on the team's later to be marketplace, [Knowhere.art (KA)](https://knowhere.art). They were so early (before Columbus-05), that the CW721 standard for NFTs didn't exist yet. That is why you don't see SpaceLoot listed on other marketplaces yet, a wrapper contract would be required for compatibility!

After minting the KA team shifted its focus on listing different early NFT projects. To accomodate the need for a professional marketplace, they continued to work on new iterations of their website, currently they are at version 3.

As their focus was shifting from their OG collection, a community member stepped up when noone expected, and made it rain with SDOLLARs :)


## Space Dollar

> On October 26th 2021 [@TheMoonMidas](https://twitter.com/TheMoonMidas) airdropped the entire total supply of SDOLLAR (15,240,278.55) to SpaceLoot holders. SDOLLAR is a CW20 token native to the Terra blockchain. To ensure a fair and decentralized distribution a cubic root formula was used. That is, the biggest airdrop amount was around 70k while the lowest was around 10k (for those who owned only one SpaceLoot). The airdrop did not include team allocations or presales. No more will ever be minted.

**Note:** SDOLLAR has two decimals only, compared to the more usual six decimals for most other tokens!

In the coming months people gathered on Discord and [The Society](https://discord.gg/spacedollars) was formed. A lot of activity occurred during these times, brainstorming on utility and use-cases for SDOLLAR and the future Loot-based ecosystem.


## Early Days

From around November 2021 till February 2022 the Society was a group of a few dozen active members on our Discord, throwing all kinds of ideas, hopes and dreams about the project. Naturally, things started to crystallize.

Without a comprehensive list, these are the things all of us agreed on:

 - we love the Terra network, most of us are Terra OGs, we would like this network to succeed and fulfill its mission

 - we are all fascinated by the original Loot project on Ethereum

 - with a community such that Terra has, we absolutely need to incentivize this bottom-up approach type of building, here, on "our" chain

 - RPG is king of the game genre as far as we are concerned, being able to roleplay in a player-owned scifi metaverse on chain is a dream of ours

 - we need to create NFTs that can be used in a system by any game developer that comes our way

 - anyone can add their own flavor by participating in the Society's life, voicing their ideas, or, creating more loot and art, complementing the existing "lego blocks" of the metaverse


> With this being said, our direction is clear, but the individual roadmap items are not set in stone. We rely on the community to converse with us on what should be our midterm priorities. We welcome you all to add your thoughts!


**Our many names:**

 - **Space Dollar** is the general currency of The Society, used for minting NFTs and for membership

 - **The Society** is our Discord community and DAO, where all the magic happens. Join us: [https://discord.gg/spacedollars](https://discord.gg/spacedollars)

 - **Lootopia** is the brand of the broader ecosystem that we are adding "legoblocks" to

## NFTs

While most of us were only blabbering about our ideas on Discord, **Midas** was pretty much the sole contributor on the technical side, learning how to use [Rust language](https://docs.terra.money/) and create the smart contracts for NFT mints.

There are a total of **eight collections** so far, in chronological order:

 - SpaceLoot
 - Character sheet
 - Weapons
 - Scraps (reward for staking SpaceLoot)
 - Terranite (reward for staking SpaceLoot)
 - SpacePets
 - Lootopians
 - Lootopian items

NFTs are detailed over at the [NFT](/nfts-01 ':target=_blank') section of Lootopia Docs!


## TerraFloki 

**Terrafloki Labs** are a bunch of Terra enthusiasts like we are, aiming to expand the ecosystem. So far they created:

 - a deflationary token (TFLOKI)
 - a DEX for liquidity
 - Floki character NFTs
 - marketplace
 - staking
 - NaaS, NFT as a subscription model

We teamed up with **TerraFloki** to provide liquidity for SDOLLAR through their DEX, and use their innovative **NFT as a Subscription** solution.

If that language is quite alien to you yet, here is some explanation!

In order for people to buy tokens like SDOLLAR a so called pool is required, in this case SDOLLAR-UST. Users can add some UST to the pool, and the same amount worth in SDOLLAR. From this pool people can take out one and give back the other, effectively making a trade. During the process the price of the assets change (there will be more of one and less of the other in the pool) as the ratio changes.


**Why is this good?**

You are helping in growing the liquidity pool, so that individual trades have less affect on the price (the change in ratio is much much smaller). As a reward, the fees of the swaps get equally distributed between the providers in relation to their stake in the pool.
 
> On the TerraFloki DEX you can provide liquidity and therefore swap SDOLLAR-UST. More interestingly you can stake SDOLLAR-LP tokens. When you allocate to a pool you get a token back in exchange, kind of like a receipt. If you have this receipt you can trade it back for your funds any time. By locking up these LP tokens you start to accumulate tickets over time. You can mint NFTs using the tickets.

> There has been two farming events so far:
>
>> - SpacePets
>> - Lootopian items
>
> You can decide to finish farming, and take out your liquidity any time, there is no lockup period.

## Stargazers

The Stargazers team consists of three Cosmos network enthusiasts. They say this about themselves:

"With all the in-fighting going in the Cosmoverse we want to unite the banners of the ecosystem and help bring together the communities! Our focus is creating a collection of generative NFT banners designed to celebrate and promote the Cosmos ecosystem!"

We also greatly appreciate the Cosmos SDK and think interoperability between chains is a natural evolution of blockchains. We believe we are stronger as a group of interconnected projects than individual ones fighting for the top rank. Therefore we appreciated it greatly, when they created a 1/1 custom NFT for us as part of their collection, this is the banner you see on this site!

## Expanding the Team

> As Lootopia is growing, it is less and less feasible for **Ser Midas** to single handedly carry the weight of creating. Some of the more active members stepped up to bring their skills to complement and offload some of the tasks, such as creating designs for the webpage, marketing, documentation, or project management.

**ADD LOOTOPIAN AVATARS for TEAM MEMBERS + Discord handle?**
