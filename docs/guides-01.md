> Hope you like our Guides :page_facing_up:! Do you think we have missed something? Drop by our [Discord](https://discord.gg/spacedollars) and let us know!

!> Make sure to double check the Lootopia Docs site you are browsing right now, the URL must be: <ADD URL>! You can also double check the official links on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/spacedollars). Look our for the **#faq** and **#important-links** channels. Don't forget, the scammers are out to get you! :rage:


## Join the Society


> Space Dollar is a CW20 token created by [@TheMoonMidas](https://twitter.com/TheMoonMidas), and airdropped to holders of SpaceLoot using a cubic root formula. The total supply of 15,240,278.55 (note the two decimals) has been allocated to owners, no team allocation, no presales.

SDOLLAR is the "official" currency of The Society, for example, the Lootopian fellows were minted for 1000 SDOLLARs a piece!

> Holding SDOLLAR, or providing liquidity will grant you entrance to channels on our Discord, that are for The Society's eyes only.

There are to ways to become members:

 - hold 10k (or more) SDOLLARs **in your wallet**
 - hold 5.5 LPs from providing SDOLLAR-UST liquidity on the TerraFloki DEX

> You never provided liquidity or did any yield farming yet? No worries, here is the deal.

Once you get this down, you will start earning yield, a portion of the trading fees paid by whoever buys or sells SDOLLAR. Simply by providing assets that you were (we are assuming) hodling on to anyway :flex:


### Get Some UST


> First, you have to get some UST. If you already have some UST in your Terra wallet, go ahead to the next section.

The general steps are as follows:

1. Move USD or your preferred currency to a centralized exchange like Coinbase, Binance, depending on your location, preference, etc.
2. Purchase native Luna or UST on these exchanges.
3. Withdraw the Luna or UST to your Terra wallet address to have custody over your funds.

> For the first two points please **refer to respectable online guides**. Research the topic before you jump in, such as what are the financial/tax legalities depending on your country of residence. [TerraBites Podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCpsyNtR05I) is a good place to start, but **do your own research**. [CoinBureau](https://www.youtube.com/c/CoinBureau) on Youtube is a respectable channel to start learning about crypto in general, Godspeed!

For creating a wallet on the Terra network you can follow the official documentation: [Terra Docs](https://docs.terra.money/index.html).

> Society membership currently costs 10,000 SDOLLAR or 5,5 LPs, but roles are also given out according to the image below. However, the **Civilian** and **Believer** roles **do not** grant you access to the Society part of Discord.

![society_entry](/images/society_entry.jpg)


### Purchase SDOLLAR


> Once you have some UST, SDOLLAR-UST liquidity is provided on the TerraFloki DEX, therefore you can buy SDOLLAR there. Remember to double check links from our Discord!
>
>> Note: If you want to provide 5.5 LP worth of liquidity rather for membership, than 5k SDOLLAR is enough, since you have to pair that with an equal worth of UST.

1. Navigate to the [TerraFloki DEX](https://terrafloki.io/app/trade) and connect your wallet.
2. By default the TFLOKI token is selected, so choose SDOLLAR from the dropdown list.
3. Specify the amount you want to trade. You need 10k SDOLLARs to be a member of the Society.

![Buy_sdollar](/images/buy_sdollar.jpg)

4. Click Swap and sign the transaction in the popup.


### Provide Liquidity


Providing liquidity is incentivized by The Society, as the bigger to pool, the smaller the individual trades affect the price!

By staking your LLP token, you can farm tickets to purchase NFTs with. Please refer to our [Discord](https://discord.gg/spacedollars) or the [TerraFloki](https://terrafloki.io/launchpad/tickets/stakelp) launchpad for current farming events.

Be aware of the risks though, such as impermanent loss, you can learn about it from the awesome video below:

[![Finematics_impermanent_loss](https://img.youtube.com/vi/8XJ1MSTEuU0/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XJ1MSTEuU0)

> You can provide liquidity by providing UST only (and the app will do the necessary swaps in the background) or by providing both UST and SDOLLAR.

**Provide liquidity using UST:**

1. Navigate to the [TerraFloki Pool](https://terrafloki.io/app/pool/provide/ust) provide UST tab.
2. From the scroll-down menu select **SDOLLAR-UST**.
3. Set the amount and inspect the outcome, how much LLP tokens will you get in return. You need 5.5 LLPs to get access to The Society.

![Liquidity_from_ust](/images/liq_from_ust.jpg)

4. If you are happy with the result click **Add Liquidity** and sign the transaction.


**Provide liquidity using SDOLLAR and UST:**

1. Navigate to the [TerraFloki Pool](https://terrafloki.io/app/pool/provide) provide tab.
2. From the scroll-down menu select **SDOLLAR**.
3. Set the amount to 5000 SDOLLAR at least and equivalent amount of UST will be selected by ther app automatically.

![Liquidity_from_ust](/images/liq_sd_ust.jpg)

4. If you are happy with the result click **Add Liquidity** and sign the transaction.

## Farm Tickets for NFTs


In order to farm tickets you must provide liquidity for the SDOLLAR-UST pair on the TerraFloki DEX. If you haven't done so yet refer to our [Join the Society](#join-the-society) guide!

To see whether there are ongoing farming events visit the [TerraFloki launchpad](https://terrafloki.io/launchpad/tickets/stakelp) or ask around in our Discord.


If you have you SDOLLAR-UST LP tokens, follow these steps:

1. Visit the [TerraFloki launchpad](https://terrafloki.io/launchpad/tickets/stakelp).
2. Under 'Stakeable' you must see your available LP tokens.

![Available_LPs](/images/farm1.jpg)

3. Specify the amount you would like to stake. You can hit 'Max' to stake all your LP tokens.

![Specify_LP_to_lock](/images/farm2.jpg)

4. The 'Stake SDOLLAR LLP' button became active, click it and sign the transaction in the popup!
5. Once the transaction is finished, you will see your staked amount and you are already earning tickets.

![See_staked_LLPs](/images/farm3.jpg)

> **Note:** for one full ticket you can mint one NFT after the farming period is over.


## Claim Reward NFTs


> To be able to claim rewards the farming period must have ended.

Follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the [TerraFloki launchpad](https://terrafloki.io/launchpad/tickets/stakelp).
2. On the left side menu click **SpacePets Loot**.i

![Minting_automat](/images/mint_machine.jpg)

3. Check your ticket balance, if you have more than 1.00 you can mint an NFT by feeding a ticket to the machine.
4. Grab the ticket and drop it over the ticket feeder.
5. Sign the transaction in the popup.
6. You can continue to mint as long as you have at least 1.00 ticket.


## How to Equip Items

![](/images/equip_lootopian.jpg)

4. Click the **Equip** button and sign the transaction to equip the item.

!> Currently you can only equip/unequip one item at a time. The solution is already underway to be able to do multiple items in one transaction.

> Unequip works the same way, first you have to choose the Lootopian that want to undress, and select which item to take off.


## Stake SpaceLoot


You can stake your SpaceLoot NFTs, four of them at max, on Knowhere.art. Follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the [Knowhere.art v2 staking site](https://v2.knowhere.art/metaverse/terra13qrc9j00lk3x0rvpptzdmwtckfj64d5g6xnrv9/staking) and connect your wallet in the top right corner.

![KA_stake_ships](/images/ka_staking_stake_now.jpg)


> **Note:** The fee for claiming the rewards is quite hefty, but there is a manual workaround to reduce the fee by a factor of ten. Please see the [Claim Scraps and Terranite](#claim-scraps-and-terranite) guide.


## Claim Scraps and Terranite

To claim your staking rewards for a fraction of the initial fee (~0.07 UST instead of 0.75 UST), follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the [Terra Station Web App](https://station.terra.money/) and connect your wallet.
2. From the menu select **Contract** and paste this string: terra16pfv2wzd89zw04090eeu35emhxdn33wq9pfcpj
3. Click **Execute**.
4. In the message field copy one of your staked ship's ID exactly as follows:

```json
{
  "claim": {
    "token_id": "<add_ID_here>"
  }
}
```

**For example**:

```
{
  "claim": {
    "token_id": "1835"
  }
}
```

5. Click **Submit** and sign the transaction.
